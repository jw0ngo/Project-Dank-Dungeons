# 2026-06-09 — A new standing entity population is a hidden input to every global census

- **Principle:** When you add a large, *persistent* cohort to a shared collection (`gEnemies`), audit
  every system that does an unfiltered scan/count over that collection. A budget or cap that counts
  "all of them" will silently misbehave the moment your cohort exists — the bug surfaces in an
  unrelated subsystem, not in your new code.
- **Why:** 40 wolf camps spawned ~160 persistent neutral wolves into `gEnemies` at run start. Each
  wolf was correct in isolation, but the night-siege stream's live-cap census
  (`for(const e of gEnemies){ if(!e.dead) live++; }`) counted them, pinning `live ≥ cap` so `room`
  was always 0 — the opening horde dropped, then *zero* stream followed. The regression was emergent:
  a subsystem that quietly assumed `gEnemies ≈ siege enemies`.
- **How to apply:** Before shipping a persistent cohort, grep every `for(...of gEnemies)` (and any
  global counter) and ask at each site, "should my new cohort count here?" Give cohorts a
  discriminator (`campId`, `isHeld`, `isNeutral`, `isAmbient`) and make each census express *intent*
  ("siege/threat-relevant"), not mere liveness. The same audit applies to separation grids, despawn
  sweeps, and any O(n) pass keyed on the shared array.
